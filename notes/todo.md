# Movement:
1) Get the python example working, and understand how toc reate our own examples. Ignore simulation and RL processes.
2) Create a python code that lets us call some movements. Figure out the imports and what are the low level methods we need.

# Integration
1) Create a minimal AI service: text in, text/speech out.
--> they only support text to speech + subtitle, and voice to answer generation
2) Wrap the service in a python wrapper
3) Plug the wrapper into the movement python code.
